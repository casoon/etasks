# Changelog

All notable changes to eTasks are listed here. eTasks follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): while in 0.x, a minor version may contain breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Releases:** every installer ships with a `.sha256` file and a signed build provenance
  attestation. Details: [Verify a download](https://github.com/casoon/etasks#verify-a-download).

### Changed

- **Contributors:** all calls into the Rust core go through `@casoon/origin-client`;
  `ui/src/lib/platform.ts` is the only file that still touches a Tauri webview API.
- **Contributors:** the export snapshot test mocks `coreBridge` again, so CI on `main` is green.

### Removed

- **Releases:** the macOS Intel (`x64`) build; macOS installers are Apple Silicon only.
